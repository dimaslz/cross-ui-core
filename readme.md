# CrossUI components

**[WIP]** At the moment this project it's an experiment just for fun and learn, with the objective to use a component UI to use in my projects. I hope to have a minimal usable release (Beta) to share with the community. If you like it, feel free to share me your support :).

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-items: center; width: 100%; margin: 50px;">
  <img src="./cross-ui-core-logo.svg" alt="CrossUI core logo" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

## Motivation

I am a [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) lover, for that I decided to use as UI this CSS utility library to stylize this components.

My idea it's to create the same style in multiple frameworks, so, a UI components cross framework. I would like to give compatibility with Vue, React and Angular from the Stencil core components. At the same time, I will try to give a Figma document with all UI system.

I motivated to do it because, when I working in some project, with either Vue, Angular or React, I choose something like material ui or bootstrap, but there are nothing based in TailwindCSS, or at least something consistent and with good support, so, for that, instead have to build a components in each framework I working, I decided to try to build some core based in web components, then I chose Stencil (to have more information about Stencil, [click here](https://stenciljs.com).
