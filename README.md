# Cross UI components
Cross UI is a agnostic components library based in [StencilJS](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil) framework. At the moment is not ready to accept collaborations or use in production. I am working on it just for fun, trying to learn something interesting, have a personal library for my projects and, if I get to have enough stable components, contribute with the OpenSource community.

In advance, thank you for your interest about it, in fact, if you want to give me some tips, recommendation or just some suggest me  what you would like to have in a components library, fill free to open an issue [https://github.com/dimaslz/cross-ui-core/issues](https://github.com/dimaslz/cross-ui-core/issues).

If you want to read more about the project, please go to [Core README](./packages/core/readme.md)
